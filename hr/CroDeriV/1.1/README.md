# Summary

Universal Derivations version of [CroDeriv](https://croderiv.ffzg.hr/).


# Introduction
CroDeriv is a morphological lexicon of Croatian language. It contains morphological and word-formation analysis of Croatian lexemes. 
Morphological analysis relates to lexeme segmentation into morphs at the surface layer and corresponding morphemes at the deep layer of the presentation. Morphological information is available for 14000 verbs, 5500 nouns and 1500 adjectives. 
Word-formation analysis presuposes the annotation of the word-formation patterns (base word/s + affixes) and the type of the word-formation processes. It is done for the subset of verbs with more than 5 representatives in the derivational family, nouns and adjectives in the database.
CroDeriv UDer v0.9 is a subset of the CroDeriv v2.0 database presented in the standard Universal Derivations v2.0 format. It currently contains ca 100 Croatian derivational families.

The data structure of CroDeriV is rooted trees by default.
