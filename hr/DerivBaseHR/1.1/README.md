# Summary

Universal Derivations version of DerivBase.HR (http://takelab.fer.hr/data/derivbasehr).


# Introduction

DerivBase.HR is an automatically created word-formation lexicon for Croatian inspired by DErivBase and DErivCELEX for German. DerivBase.Hr includes nouns, adjectives, and verbs taken from a large Croatian webcorpus. The resource is distributed in a data package that contains two variants of DerivBase.HR created by: (a) an unsupervised clustering based on string distance, and (b) a knowledge-based approach using an inflectional lexicon and a set of word-formation rules. The authors recommend the knowledge-based version because of its higher quality.

DerivBase.HR has been harmonized automatically using Machine Learning method.
