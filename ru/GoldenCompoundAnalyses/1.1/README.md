# Summary

Universal Derivations version of manually created Russian compounding relations extracted from Golden Compound Analyses (hhttp://nabil.hathout.free.fr/DeriMo2021/pdf-files/DeriMo_2021_paper_10.pdf).


# Introduction

Golden Compound Analyses resource is a data set that capture Russian compounding relations which originates from Russkaya grammatika by Shvedova et al.

As the resource contains only compound lexemes, the data structure of the original resource was converted to the UDer format only (without necessity of additional harmonisation of the relations).


# Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all the developers and annotators of the Golden Compound Analyses, including Daniil Vodolazsky, and Hermann Petrov.
