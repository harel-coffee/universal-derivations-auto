# Summary

Universal Derivations version of Word Formation Latin (https://wflblog.wordpress.com/) extracted from LEMLAT v3.0 (https://github.com/CIRCSE/LEMLAT3).


# Introduction

Word Formation Latin (WFL) is a derivational morphology resource for Classical Latin, where lemmas are analysed into their formative components, and relationships between them are established on the basis of Word Formation Rules. For example 'amo' (to love) and 'amator' (lover) are connected with a relationship that describes a change from a verb to a noun through the addition of a suffix (-a-tor) that in itself bears semantic information (in this case it characterises agentive and instrumental nouns, i.e. someone or something performing an action). WFL has been included in Morphological analyzer and lemmatizer for Latin, LEMLAT.

Word Formation Latin has been harmonized manually.


# Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all the developers and annotators of the Word Formation Latin, including Eleonora Litta, Marco Passarotti, and Chris Culy.
