# Summary

Universal Derivations version of DeriNet.FA.


# Introduction

DeriNet.FA is DeriNet-like lexical network of that captures core word-formation relations for Persian. It is based on a top of manually created Persian Morphologically Segmented Lexicon (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3011). Derivational relations were identified automatically within lexemes (Haghdoost et et al., 2019).

The data structure of DeriNet.FA is rooted trees by default.


# Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all of the developers and annotators of the DeriNet.FA, including Hamid Haghdoost, Ebrahim Ansari, Zdeněk Žabokrtský, and Mahshid Nikravesh.
