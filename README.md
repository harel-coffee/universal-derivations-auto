# Universal Derivations

A repository containing script used for compiling both the individual UDer resources and the whole UDer collection.


## Introduction

Universal Derivations (UDer) is a collection of harmonized lexical networks capturing word-formation, especially derivation, in a cross-linguistically consistent annotation scheme for many languages. The annotation scheme is based on a rooted tree data structure (as used in the [DeriNet 2.0](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet) database), in which nodes correspond to lexemes while edges represent derivational relations or compounding.

Each individual resource in the UDer collection can be searched online using [DeriSearch](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/universal-derivations/derisearch) and the data can be processed using [DeriNet 2.0 API](https://github.com/vidraj/derinet/tree/master/tools/data-api/derinet2).

For detailed information see [Universal Derivations webpage](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/universal-derivations).
