# Universal Derivations

## Introduction

Universal Derivations (UDer) is a collection of harmonised lexical networks capturing word-formation, especially derivation, in a cross-linguistically consistent annotation scheme for many languages. The annotation scheme is based on a rooted tree data structure (as used in the [DeriNet 2.0](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet) database), in which nodes correspond to lexemes while edges represent relations between lexemes (derivation, compounding, conversion, spelling variants etc.). For more details see [Universal Derivations webpage](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/universal-derivations).


## Related tools

Each individual resource in the UDer collection can be:
- searched online using [DeriSearch v2](https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/derisearch2/v2/databases/),
- processed using [DeriNet API](https://github.com/vidraj/derinet/tree/master/tools/data-api/derinet2).

For the DeriNet API, there are Jupyter Notebook manuals with:
- [description of the objects and functions from API](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1so-LDMNDghtZw68eG5VT2WdJoD-0Se9f?usp=sharing),
