# Summary

Universal Derivations version of CatVar, the Categorial Variation Database (https://clipdemos.umiacs.umd.edu/catvar/ and https://github.com/nizarhabash1/catvar).


# Introduction

CatVar is an automaticallyconstructed word-formation database of English derivationally related nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. Word-formation families were based on the morphological segmentation obtained from several morphological segmenters and the English part of CELEX. Some relations were also included from ADJADV (NomBank).

CatVar has been harmonized automatically using Machine Learning method.


# Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all the developers and annotators of CatVar, including Nizar Habash and Bonnie Dorr.
